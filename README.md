HTML5 Message Channel
---------------------

[Demo](http://threadcomm.appspot.com)


Message Channel is a communication mechanism for message passing between to two different contexts. It was implemented with two ports, messages sent in one port are delivered at other port.
This is the only way to establish direct communication between webworkers. This project will demonstrate how it works.
